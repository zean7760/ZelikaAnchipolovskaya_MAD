My app Exercise more will be a “spin off” from my project 1. The app with prompt the user for information about the work they just completed.

1.The user will select the date the workout was completed with a date picker

2.The user will select the time the workout was completed with a time picker

3.The user selects the intensity of the workout (3 options: easy, medium, hard)
	a.These will be picture icons
		i.If not select the they will be a default icon
		ii.If selected then the same icon will change into a darker color indicating selection.

4.The user selects the type of workout (2 options: cardio, strength)
	a.These will be picture icons
		i.If not select the they will be a default icon
		ii.If selected then the same icon will change into a darker color indicating selection.

5.After all the fields are selected
	a.The user pushes a confirm button which takes them to a new activity page.
	b.If something is not selected a toast will appear.

6.The new activity page will have a history of all of the information that was selected in the previous page.

7.If all of this is done I will try to make it that the history saves all of the information.
